# Cloudflare Pages Ignore File
# This project should NOT be deployed to Cloudflare Pages
# It uses Vercel for the main application and Cloudflare Workers for API Gateway

# Ignore everything to prevent Pages builds

!.cfpagesignore

# This file exists to:
# 1. Signal that Pages deployment is not intended
# 2. Prevent accidental Pages builds
# 3. Force build failures if Pages is misconfigured

# Correct deployment architecture:
# - Main App: Vercel (Next.js)
# - API Gateway: Cloudflare Workers (wrangler.toml)
# - Storage: Cloudflare KV
