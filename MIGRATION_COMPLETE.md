# Migration to Cloudflare KV Complete

## Summary
The migration from Vercel KV to Cloudflare KV has been completed successfully. All security issues have been addressed and the application now uses Cloudflare KV exclusively for data storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Security Fixes
- Removed all exposed API credentials from the repository
- Replaced hardcoded values with placeholders in all documentation files
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future credential exposure
- Fixed the following files:
  - `DUAL_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_ENV_SETUP.md` 
  - `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
  - `scripts/setup-cloudflare-kv.sh`
  - `FINAL_STATUS.md`
  - `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
  - `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SETUP.md`
  - `wrangler.toml`

### 2. Vercel KV Removal
- Removed `@vercel/kv` dependency from `package.json`
- Updated all core files to use Cloudflare KV:
  - `app/page.tsx` - Removed last remaining `kv.set()` call
  - `app/api/ranking/route.ts` - Now uses Cloudflare KV exclusively
  - `app/api/cron/fetch/route.ts` - Writes only to Cloudflare KV
  - `lib/update-ranking.ts` - Uses Cloudflare KV for all operations
  - `lib/popular-tags.ts` - Completely rewritten for Cloudflare KV
  - `lib/ng-filter.ts` - Temporarily uses localStorage (server-side disabled)

### 3. Test Updates
- Updated `vitest.setup.ts` to use Cloudflare KV environment variables
- Some tests may need updates due to changes in popular tags handling

## Current State

### Working Features
✅ Ranking data fetching and display
✅ Cloudflare KV integration for all data storage
✅ Cron job updates (via GitHub Actions)
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Security: No exposed credentials

### Temporary Limitations
⚠️ NG filtering is client-side only (using localStorage)
⚠️ Some utility scripts still reference Vercel KV (not critical)
⚠️ Build process has known SIGBUS issue (use Vercel for builds)

## Environment Variables Required

### Cloudflare KV
```bash
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-cloudflare-account-id>
CLOUDFLARE_KV_NAMESPACE_ID=<your-kv-namespace-id>
CLOUDFLARE_KV_API_TOKEN=<your-cloudflare-api-token>
```

### Other Required Variables
```bash
CRON_SECRET=<your-cron-secret>
WORKER_AUTH_KEY=<your-worker-auth-key>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Push changes to main branch
   - Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Remove Vercel KV environment variables

2. **Verify Production**
   - Check that ranking data loads correctly
   - Verify cron job updates work
   - Monitor Cloudflare KV usage

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Implement proper backend storage for NG lists
   - Update remaining utility scripts
   - Consider implementing edge caching for better performance

## Breaking Changes
- Vercel KV environment variables (`KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`) are no longer needed
- NG filtering is temporarily client-side only
- Popular tags backup system has been removed (handled by Cloudflare KV)

## Security Notes
- All exposed credentials have been removed from the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Never commit actual credentials to the repository
