# Vercel KV Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of Vercel KV dependencies and migration to Cloudflare KV for the Nico Ranking Custom application.

## Security Fixes Completed

### 1. Removed Exposed Credentials
- **vercel-env-vars.txt**: Replaced all hardcoded credentials with placeholders
- **.env.local**: Replaced all hardcoded credentials with placeholders
- **scripts/set-cloudflare-env.sh**: Updated to read from environment variables
- **scripts/set-vercel-env.sh**: Updated to read from environment variables

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added patterns to prevent future exposure:
- `scripts/set-*.sh`
- `vercel-env-vars.txt`
- `*.env`
- `.env.*`

### 3. Created Documentation
- **ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md**: Comprehensive guide for environment variables
- **.env.local.example**: Example file with placeholder values

## Vercel KV Removal

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Removed `@vercel/kv` from package.json

### 2. Core Library Updates
- **lib/update-ranking.ts**: Removed all Vercel KV write operations, now only uses Cloudflare KV
- **lib/popular-tags.ts**: Completely rewritten to use Cloudflare KV instead of Vercel KV
- **lib/ng-filter.ts**: Temporarily uses localStorage for client-side NG list storage (server-side disabled)

### 3. API Routes Updates
- **app/api/ranking/route.ts**: Removed Vercel KV, now uses Cloudflare KV exclusively
- **app/api/cron/fetch/route.ts**: Removed all Vercel KV operations
- **app/page.tsx**: Updated to use Cloudflare KV as primary data source

### 4. Test Configuration
- **vitest.setup.ts**: Updated mock environment variables from Vercel KV to Cloudflare KV

## Migration Path

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Update Environment Variables**: Remove Vercel KV credentials from production
2. **Run Data Migration**: Use `scripts/migrate-to-cloudflare-kv.ts` to migrate existing data
3. **Update GitHub Secrets**: Replace Vercel KV tokens with Cloudflare KV tokens

### Future Considerations
1. **NG List Storage**: Currently using localStorage, needs a proper backend solution
2. **Script Updates**: Many utility scripts still reference Vercel KV and need updating
3. **Test Updates**: Some test files may still have Vercel KV references

## Breaking Changes
- NG filtering is now client-side only (no server-side persistence)
- Popular tags backup system has been removed (handled by Cloudflare KV)
- Some debug/utility scripts may no longer work without updates

## Benefits
1. **Single Storage Solution**: All ranking data now in Cloudflare KV
2. **Improved Security**: No more exposed credentials in the repository
3. **Better Performance**: Cloudflare KV with compression for large datasets
4. **Cost Reduction**: Eliminated Vercel KV costs

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes to production
2. Run the migration script to move existing data
3. Monitor for any issues with the new storage system
4. Consider implementing a proper solution for NG list storage
